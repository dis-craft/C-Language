datatypes in c: 
the datatypes in c should be predefined in the declaration statements.

the datatypes are: 
1. integer
    syntax: int a; 
    memory allocation 4 bytes or 32 bits.

    int has a range of values that it can store, typically from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 in a 32-bit system.
    It is a signed data type by default, meaning it can store both positive and negative values.
    You can also define it as unsigned to store only non-negative values, doubling the positive range.
    format specifier is %d, %
    Example of using unsigned int: unsigned int b;
2. float 
    syntax: float a;
    memory allocation 4 bytes or 32 bits
    takes decimal values, it can store upto 7 decimal places.
    format specifier is %f
    All the real number literals are of double type by default. We can append an “f” at the end of the literal to define it as float type.
