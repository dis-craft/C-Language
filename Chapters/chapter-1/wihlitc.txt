datatypes in c: 
the datatypes in c should be predefined in the declaration statements.


the datatypes are: 
1. integer
    syntax: int a; 
    memory allocation 4 bytes or 32 bits.

    int has a range of values that it can store, typically from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 in a 32-bit system.
    It is a signed data type by default, meaning it can store both positive and negative values.
    You can also define it as unsigned to store only non-negative values, doubling the positive range.

    Example of using unsigned int: unsigned int b;
